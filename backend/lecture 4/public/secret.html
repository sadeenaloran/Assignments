      The real magic behind modern AI models like ChatGPT lies in a powerful
      concept called the Transformer architecture, particularly the "Attention
      mechanism." While most people focus on the massive size of these
      models—often containing billions of parameters—the true secret is how they
      pay attention to different parts of a sentence. The Attention mechanism
      enables the model to determine which words are most important for
      understanding the overall meaning, allowing it to focus more on those key
      elements. For instance, in the sentence “Sami went to the market because
      he forgot his wallet,” the model understands that "he" refers to Sami, not
      the market—thanks to attention. So, the secret isn't just in the model's
      size; it's in how intelligently it processes language. Curious to discover
      more secrets, like hidden uses of AI, AI in hacking, or future tech?
